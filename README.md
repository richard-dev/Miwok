# Miwok
Miwok project from Udacity.

My project differs slightly from Udacity in that I use one LoadActivity.java file instead of four separate activities java files for Numbers, Family Members, Colors and Phrases. With the use of intent passed from MainActivity, LoadActivity will display the correct activity with switch statements.

This project utilizies these concepts:

ArrayAdapters
Load ListView with list items using custom ArrayAdapter that uses custom ArrayList.

ArrayLists
create custom ArrayLists to accept more than one parameter.

ListViews

setOnItemClickListener
releaes MediaPlayer resources so that the app doesn't keep starting a new MediaPlayer and overlap.

MediaPlayer
play audio files.
